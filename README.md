Whispr is dead simple, zero account, disposable chat. Our goal with the project
was to make setting up a chat room as simple as sharing a URL. On top of that
Whispr is _private_â€”the only way to get to your room is by knowing its URL and
chats are deleted after an hour of inactivity.

This project is simply a prototype, but I liked the idea so much that I've been
working on a new version of it in my spare time. You can follow along with the
development of this new version at [rpowelll/whispr][repo].
